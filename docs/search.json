Assume also that patients receive some total benefit from care received, reflected by the equation \\(B(x)=10x - (1/2)x^{2}\\). Patients must pay the full price, \\(p\\), of any care received, so that the net benefit of care to the patient is then \\(B(x)-px\\) (their total benefit less their costs). Finally, assume that the best outside option for the patient yields a net benefit of 8.\n\nIf the patient were to choose \\(x\\) to maximize their net benefit, what level of \\(x\\) would they choose?\nFind the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, \\(x\\). You need to solve this as a function of \\(c\\).\nAt a marginal cost of \\(c=2\\), find the physician’s optimal price, \\(p\\).\nCompare the physician’s profit maximizing choice of \\(x\\) to the patient’s optimal choice of \\(x\\). Are these the same? Why or why not?\n\nAssume instead that the physician faces a fixed price, \\(\\bar{p}=5\\). The setup is otherwise identical to question 1.\n\nIf the patient were to choose \\(x\\) to maximize their net benefit, what level of \\(x\\) would they choose?\nAgain assuming \\(c=2\\), find the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, \\(x\\). Hint: marginal cost doesn’t matter here except to ensure that \\(c&lt;\\bar{p}\\).\nHow does the deviation in the physician and patient optima differ from what you found in question 1? Explain your answer in a couple of sentences.\n\nAssume now that the physician can affect the number of their patients through their influence on the net benefit (NB) provided to patients. Assume also that the physician faces a fixed price paid by the insurer, denoted \\(p_{s}\\), along with a capitated payment per patient, \\(R\\), and that the patient faces a price of $0, \\(p_{d}=0\\). In this extension, the physician’s goal is to choose \\(x\\) so as to maximize profit, \\[\\pi = n\\left(NB\\right) \\left[R + (p_{s}-c)x \\right].\\] Finally, assume the functional forms \\(n(NB)=\\sqrt{NB}\\) and \\(B(x)=10x-x^{2}\\).\n\nFind the patient’s optimal level of \\(x\\).\nFind the first order condition for the physician’s choice of \\(x\\). Don’t try to solve this for \\(x\\).\nAssuming that the physician makes $1 on each quantity of care provided (\\(p_{s}-c=1\\)), find the value of the capitated payment, \\(R\\), such that overtreatment is minimized. Please assume that \\(x\\) can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of overtreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.\nAssuming that the physician loses $1 on each quantity of care provided (\\(p_{s}-c=-1\\)), find the value of the capitated payment, \\(R\\), such that undertreatment is minimized. Again, assume that \\(x\\) can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of undertreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.\nWhich scenario (minimizing overtreatment or undertreatment) is better for the physician’s profit."

    "text": "Empirical Questions\n\nIn January 2014, CMS reduced it’s payments to physicians for epidural steroidal injections (CPT codes 62310, 62311, 62318, and 62319). The reduction was part of an effort to adjust “potentially misvalued services,” in which CMS lowered the payment rates back to 2013 levels. CMS subsequently increased the payment levels in 2015. Talk about whiplash! For this question, we’re going to use the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data from 2013 through 2015 to see how these payment changes may have affected the frequency of epidural steroidal injections. These data are available on our OneDrive folder for homework 2, the link to which is on Canvas. The data are available as an R data set, hwk2_data_q4.Rdata, or as a tab-delimited text file hwk2_data_q4.txt. Take a look at the data in your favorite software, and answer the following questions:\n\nHow many unique physicians administered at least one epidural steroidal injection in 2013?\nAmong those physicians, what was the average number of injections in each year (2013 through 2015)? Use a graph to support your answer.\nAmong physicians with some injections in both 2013 and 2014, identify the physicians with the 10 largest reductions in injections from 2013 to 2014 (i.e., I want to see the physicians with the largest reductions, but exclude physicians that dropped to 0).\nFor the physicians identified in part 3, plot the number of injections for each physician over time (scatter plot with the count of injections on the vertical axis and year on the horizontal axis).\n\nIn January 2021, CMS changed its physician fee schedule, instituting relatively large increases for “Evaluation and Management” (E&M, or just office visits) codes. But, due to budget neutrality requirements, such an increase required an offset for other services. Therefore, CMS also lowered the overall “conversion factor”. This made more expensive services in 2020 relatively less profitable, while payments for otherwise less expensive services were less affected (E&M services, of course, actually increased in payment rate). For this question, we’re going to again work with the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data (hwk2_data_q5.Rdata as an R data set or hwk2_data_q5.txt as a tab-delimited text file). We’ll focus only on physicians in Georgia because the full data is a little too much to manage for this assignment. Please be sure to take a look at the primer, available here, for more details about the policy and payment changes. Then answer the following questions:\n\nIdentify a set of HCPCS codes that capture physician office visits. Do some internet digging first, just to see if you can find the codes that way. Ultimately, the best strategy is probably to identify the relevant codes based on the observed descriptions in the data.\nIdentify the physicians with the most (top 10) E&M visits in 2020.\nHow much would these physicians from part B (the top 10 physicians) stand to gain from the increased RVU rate? Show your results in a table. You can see the percentage increases from the CMS Final Rule Discussion document on Canvas.\nIn the context of physician agency, what might you predict will happen to utilization of more expensive services after the 2021 fee schedule update?"

In advocating for “research and evidence-based policy,” it’s critical your brief has a solid foundation. There are high quality sources that aren’t scholarly, of course. You may find it very useful to additionally have sources from news organizations, government websites or publications, official reports, and think tanks. The trick here is to really evaluate the quality and impartiality of the source. Look up the background of think tanks and organizations on Wikipedia or other sources and be clear about how the quality of the source shapes the arguments made in the brief.\nYour sources should be carefully selected to contribute different pieces to the puzzle. Make sure you have sources about background/context, other sources more on evaluating policy, perhaps some news stories about recent events. You want your brief to be well-rounded and not missing any big gaps in pertinent information. You may not end up using all the sources in your fact sheet and policy brief, but the more sources you identify now, the easier it will be to refine your points. You may also find that as you’re working on your project, you will need to find new sources. Additionally, sources do not have to be on the exact same topic, but they should relate. Remember that there can be regional, political, and socioeconomic differences (to name a few) that might make some work not generally applicable."

    "text": "Writing annotations\nThe annotated bibliography will serve as the foundation for the basic facts you will outline for the reader to understand the problem at hand, and it will provide the basis of the evidence you provide to substantiate your claims. Basically, the annotated bibliography is a bibliography with a brief summary (i.e., annotation) of each source. Your annotations may include the following information:\n\nWhat question do(es) the author(s) seek to answer?\nWhat is the primary thesis/argument/theory of the work?\nHow is this source relevant to my topic? What aspect of my research question/topic does this source illuminate?\nWhat are the main findings? Are there reasons to doubt the evidence? What are some of the problems (e.g. clarity, methodological issues, out-of-date) with the source?\n\nWhen writing the annotation, you should provide enough information in about three to five (grammatically correct, full) sentences for readers to obtain an accurate understanding of the source’s purpose, content, and value. It should be clear how this article is contributing to your project; you may want to make this explicit. For each source, you should provide the full bibliographic citation followed by a brief analysis of the source (Citation format is your choice. Just be consistent.)"

    "text": "Learning outcomes\nThe broad goal of the class is to understand the structure of health care markets in the U.S. The course is designed around three areas, reflecting the different interactions an individual would have when navigating the health care system — first choosing an insurance plan, then visiting a physician, and ultimately receiving hospital care. Our discussion of hospital care is further divided into issues of hospital objective functions, measuring hospital quality, and hospital competition and pricing. For each segment, we will examine underlying theoretical model(s), consider empirical evidence in the area, and discuss relevant health care policy. My specific goals are that, by the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the structure of the U.S. health care system, its main components, and its history;\nModel adverse selection in health insurance, examine its effects on health insurance markets, and support your arguments with existing data;\nExplain the physician agency problem, use a model of physician agency to examine financial incentives in health care, and summarize empirical evidence on the presence of physician agency;\nDescribe hospital pricing, negotiation with insurers, and explain (qualitatively and quantitatively) the differences between charges and prices; and\nAnalyze hospital data in a real-life setting and discuss the likely effects of real-life policies."

    "text": "Course materials\n\nWhere to go\nIf you’re here, then you know where to find our class website. Well done! Hopefully it’s clear by the existence of the site that this is where I plan to host most of our course materials such as notes/slides, assignments, practice problems, etc. I’ll also use Canvas to distribute any papers or specific readings that aren’t available publicly, as well as post information that I don’t want public like virtual meeting passwords (if needed) and grades.\n\n\nReadings\nThere are two optional textbooks for this class. One is an intermediate microeconomics textbook that will cover much of the basic economic theory, and another is a health economics textbook. These books are in now way required, but they may be helpful for some students as an additional resource.\n\nPindyck and Rubinfeld (2018)\nSloan and Hsieh (2012)\n\nWe will supplement these textbooks with other readings as well as online presentations, policy papers, and videos. I’m also writing a textbook specifically for this class (very much a work in progress at this point). A comprehensive list of materials and potential readings are available from the schedule page.\n\n\nStatistics software\nEach assignment will generally include both a theoretical and empirical section. Most of the empirical work involves basic summary statistics. This can be done in just about any spreadsheet or statistics package. I’ll use R for my work, but you are free to use whatever software you’re most comfortable with. I encourage you to use R or Python simply because these are the most common programs used in applied data analysis right now, but you can certainly use Excel or Google Sheets if you’d prefer. This is not a statistics or econometrics class, so I do not expect you to have any statistics programming knowledge. I will post a few instructional videos to help with specific programming issues or Excel steps.\n\n\nAccessing data\nFor all assignments and in-class activities, I will house all of the links to the data on our class website, and I’ll place the relevant datasets in a shared OneDrive folder. For transparency, I will also point you to other GitHub repositories where available. If you’re new to Git or GitHub and want to understand some of that better, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R. But please note, knowledge of Git or GitHub is not expected or required for this class.\n\n\nTurning things in\nAll assignments should be submitted as PDF files on Canvas. Since we’ll be using some math in all of our answers, I encourage everyone to complete your assignments in Overleaf. As an Emory student, everyone has access to an institutional Overleaf account, which provides you with all the nice features of the product. You can use this to easily write PDF documents in a language known as “LaTeX”. For a brief introductory video and links to more info, please see the video here. Overleaf is not a requirement, but I think it will save some you time in the long run. You are also welcome to use Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, etc., and convert to PDF for your final submission.\nThe only requirements are that your submission is a PDF and that your answers are legible and organized. Please DO NOT write tiny answers in margins of papers, scan as PDF, and submit. I will not grade these types of submissions, and the assignment will be considered late until a legible submission is available."

Rollins, R432. I’m also available outside of these times. I just ask that you schedule an appointment in advance. Make an appointment with me here.\nWhile we call these “office hours” they really should be “student hours”. These are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. Take a look at this video for a more interesting presentation of what office hours really are and why you should come!\n\n\nFor any questions that you don’t think need a meeting, you can always reach out to me through email. I do my best to respond within 24 hours to all emails.\n\n\nTA\nTA information pending…\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe Emory University Honor Code is taken seriously and governs all work in this course. Details about the Honor Code are available here. By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to cheat on exams, to plagiarize, to deviate from the instructions about collaboration on work that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You agree that the teacher is entitled to move you to another seat during examinations, without explanation. You also affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to report them to the honor council.\n\n\nAccessibility services\nIf you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at accessibility@emory.edu. To register with OAS, students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS office.\n\n\nClass-wide announcements\nI will post regular announcements to the class on Canvas, so please set up your notifications accordingly. I will also use Canvas to post all grades and any other information that needs to stay in the class. All other course materials will be available on our class website, econ372f23.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com.\n\n\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or Emory police (404-727-6111).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Emory. If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me or directly to Emory’s Office of Respect (470-270-5360)."
